# OpcuaBusAbstraction

OpcuaBusAbstraction abstracts underlying messagebus to provide a common set of APIs needed for publish and subscribe.
The C example program demonstrates publish and subscription over OPCUA bus only (`OPCUA is the only messagebus supported for now`)

## How to Test from present working directory

### 1. Pre-requisite

> **NOTE**:
> The `Pre-requisite` section below is `only` needed if executing from
> the IEI repo. It should not be run from IEI dist libs path
> (/opt/intel/iei/dist_libs). If run, it would fail and one may have to re-create
> dist_libs to overcome any issue thereafter.

  ```sh
